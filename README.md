# Immersive Revisited (ES-DE Version)
A simple theme for the version of EmulationStation used in [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/) v2.x.  The design inspired by the great work by Darren Carol (aka Mr. Overlay) on the [Immersive theme](https://github.com/DarrenCarol/Immersive) for Batocera.

## Changes Made from the Batocera version
* Removed all Batocera specific elements to make the theme compatible with ES-DE's theming engine
* Updated system image names to match the standard used by RetroPie and ES-DE
* Redesigned the design/layout of system and gamelist views
* Added controller/icon artwork for each system
